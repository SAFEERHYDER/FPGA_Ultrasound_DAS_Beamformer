# Medical_Ultrasound
Medical Ultrasound System used to diagnose various diseases. It is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendors, muscles, joints, blood vessels, and internal organs. It is for these resons and because of its safe and non-ionizing nature that ultrasound is become important tool for medicine. Emerging techniques with high precision and quantity in Medical Ultrasound Imaging have increased the pixel resolution, frames per second, and the number of computations. These emerging technologies take a computational time to process. FPGA is the computing platform for this system. FPGA is highly efficient for parallel processing and for massive calculations. Therefore ZYNQ device is used. The ZYNQ is the integration of both dual-core ARM Cortex A-9 processor (PS) with traditional Field Programmable Logic Array (FPGA) logic fabric (PL) in a single device. This architecture is communicating by AXI-interface, which is capable of high bandwidth and low latency between two devices. Most of the module were implemented in hardware, using Verilog HDL, taking a full advantages of the parallelism, which allowed to obtain computational performance. The ARM processor is responsible for performing some tasks, i.e. helbert transform and spatial filtering.
